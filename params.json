{"name":"Av scripts","tagline":"A repository of handy scripts I've written since starting my PhD.","body":"### \"Installation\" instructions\r\nClone this repository (or, if you don't want to install git, downloading and unzipping works too)\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/kundajelab/av_scripts.git\r\n```\r\nSet the environment variable \"UTIL_SCRIPTS_DIR\" to point to the location of your cloned repository.\r\n```\r\n$ export UTIL_SCRIPTS_DIR=/path/to/av_scripts\r\n```\r\nFinally, add the 'exec' directory in av_scripts to your path:\r\n```\r\n$ export PATH=$PATH:$UTIL_SCRIPTS_DIR/exec\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Additional convenience:\r\nIt is a good idea to add the export command to the end of your ~/.bashrc file (or create it if one doesn't exist) if you don't want to have to keep running it every time you log in. You can do this with:\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"export UTIL_SCRIPTS_DIR=/path/to/av_scripts\" >> ~/.bashrc\r\n$ echo \"export PATH=$PATH:$UTIL_SCRIPTS_DIR/exec\" >> ~/.bashrc\r\n```\r\nAlso, if you don't already have a ~/.bash_profile file, you should run the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"source ~/.bashrc\" >> ~/.bash_profile\r\n```\r\n(an explanation of the difference between ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc is here: http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html)\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nEmail avanti.shrikumar [at] gmail [dot] com or avanti [at] stanford [dot] edu with anything!
